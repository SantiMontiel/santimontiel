üìö I am a __researcher__ and __master's student__ at University of Alcal√°. Right now, my work on research is focused on RADAR Perception for Autonomous Vehicles using state-of-the-art sensors and Machine Learning algorithms. As for the student aspect, I am currently on the second year of a M. Sc. degree in Industrial Engineering, focused on Robotics and Perception.

ü§ñ As for my previous notable works, I developed my Bachelor's Final Project: "Multi-Object Tracking system based on LiDAR and RADAR for Intelligent Vehicles applications" which was qualified with Honors. I designed a traditional ML-based perception pipeline performing a sensor fusion between both sensors. I was also a member of UAH Robotics Team for three years (2019-2022). We became the Champions of Eurobot Spain (April 2022) and we participated in the Eurobot International Finals at France (May 2022).

üñ•Ô∏è During my upcoming projects, I would like to focus on learning Deep Learning techniques for Computer Vision and Point Clouds (2D/3D Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation) and the theoretical background behind these tecnologies.
